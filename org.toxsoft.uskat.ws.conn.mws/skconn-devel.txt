Questions:
1. Do we need one more ESkAuthentificationType.WITH_ROLE ?
2. 

Main concepts:
  * list of servers are stored in the separate dedicated file
  * the are several modes of operation (connection to the server):
    - automatically connect to the specified server from the list
    - automatically connect to the last server from the list
    - no automatic connection, user must select from list
    - no automatic connection, user must manually connect to the predefined server
  * any connection, even automatic one requires user to authentificate via login/role/password
  * last login/role may be stored for authentification (depending on option: NONE / CFG_FILE)
  * user may or may not edit list of servers
  * options are processed at startup in following sequence: buil-in defaults, configuration file, command line arguments
  * single entry in the servers list may contain several addresses for automatic switching
  
  
Under questions:
  * how about storing possible logins/roles? or maybe roles list is requested during startup?
